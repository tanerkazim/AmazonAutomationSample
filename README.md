### Things that I used:
* Selenium
* Cucumber
* JUnit
* Log4j
* WebDriver Manager

#### Notes:
- Test log files will be automatically create under _../target/testLogs/_ directory
- I used _bonigarcia webdrivermanager_ for automatically detect Chrome version and download required driver version, 
so you don't need to configure webdriver manually
